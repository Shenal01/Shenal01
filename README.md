<p><em>Cyber Security, Machine Learning Enthusist and Bugbounty Hunter and <br><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"><br><br>
 I am a Trainer, Researcher, Consultant who is based on South Asia , who has a keen interest in Web Application Security and who enjoy doing bug bounties.

Coming to the practical implementation, I love making scripts in Bash and tools in golang to automate processes that take lots of time while pentesting web applications. On the way of doing that made me think to write blogs on the hunting Bugs so that I can share my experience with other enthusiasts

## Projects üèó

### [sebs-scholarship](https://github.com/sebs-scholarship)

This is my non-profit organization and where the majority of my contributions have been lately. We are a 501(c)(3) charity and all work is volunteer. We have a few [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) websites that I developed and maintain.

**We build our products primarily in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.**

### [github/super-linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter)

Developed by and maintained by GitHub, super-linter is a compilation of code-analysis tools to help find errors in code in a CI/CD pipeline. I use this tool in many of my repositories, and I try to make contributions here anytime I find an issue.

**The project is primarily written in Shell/BASH.**

### [CrimsonWarpedcraft/MobPortals](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/MobPortals)

A [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) Minecraft plugin which allows players to teleport or run commands by clicking non-player characters. I used this project to teach myself more about [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as a CI/CD pipeline. I also used [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) in this project to practice more with unit testing.

**This project is written in Java/Groovy.**
